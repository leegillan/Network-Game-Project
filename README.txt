CMP303 - Networking and Game Development README

Start the server.exe first, then connect the client through presing the connect button. 
Will not work if you just try to connect the client without the server. 

Controls:
	Escape - Show Cursor
	WASD - Movement
	Space - Jump
	Mouse 0 - Shoot
	E - Throw Grenade
	C - Chat Box Toggle
	T - Toggle Server Model

IMPORTANT:
IF PROMPTED, ALLOW THE APPLICATION THROUGH FIREWALL OR YOU WONT BE ABLE TO CONNECT

The server build allows for 5 clients to join just to show the scalability of the server. 
BUT if more than 2 players connect then the enemy health UI will not be correct for all players.
Each player gets their own enemy health, which in itself could be a cool idea. But is not intended.

I included the console application that I created before porting to Unity. I'm sure you can connect to it but I don't think it will work entirely well.
